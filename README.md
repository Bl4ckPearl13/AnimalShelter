# AnimalShelter
A small tool to record and manage the animals in a shelter with a JavaFX GUI.
The project was created for the final exam of a java course.

The project was created with IntelliJ Idea and you need to include the JavaFX SDK 16 (lib folder) as an external Library to test it in IntelliJ Idea. The application uses a MySQL DB on your local machine (port: 3306). I used XAMPP to run Apache and MySQL.
